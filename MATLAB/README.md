# Shaking Table

## WARNING

!!!THE CONTROLLER SOFTWARE CURRENTLY HAS _NO_ SAFETY FEATURES (SUCH AS LIMIT SWITCHES), BE CAREFUL WHEN USING METHODS THAT WERE NOT TESTED EXTENSIVELY. INJURY TO YOU OR THE TABLE IS POSSIBLE!!!
It is entirely possible that settings in the simulation code and in the controller contradict each other. E.g. if the motor has a different value for the time step size, the table might behave very unexpectedly.
